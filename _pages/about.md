I am a PhD student at the [Institute for Analytical Sociology](https://liu.se/en/organisation/liu/iei/ias) in Norrköping, Sweden. My research focuses on discovering and explaining inequalities, biases, and discriminatory practices using textual digital traces. Besides, I am interested in social and cultural change - how changes in individual opinions, beliefs and meanings lead to shifts at a collective level. I am generally curious about using computational text analysis to answer sociological questions.

Along with learning how to do good research during my PhD journey, I find important making academia a friendlier place for women and making visible mental health issues so common among academics.

I am Anastasia, a PhD student at the [Institute for Analytical Sociology](https://liu.se/en/organisation/liu/iei/ias) in Norrköping, Sweden. My research interests include exploring and explaining inequalities, biases, and discriminatory attitudes we find in textual digital traces and understanding how opinions, beliefs and meanings are shaped. I am generally curious about how computational text analysis methods can be used to answer sociological questions.

Besides learning how to make good research during my academic journey, I would also like to contribute to making academia a friendlier place for women and making mental health struggles so common in academia more visible.

PhD Studies
======
I am doing my research under the umbrella of [Mining for Meaning](https://liu.se/en/research/computational-text-analysis) project, where my colleagues and I study Swedish immigration debate using large-scale text corpora and quantitative text analysis methods. My PhD advisors are [Marc Keuschnigg](https://keuschnigg.org/) and [Måns Magnusson](https://www.mansmagnusson.com/).

Master's Experiences
======
I received MSc in Sociology and Social Research from Utrecht University, the Netherlands. Alongside my studies there, I worked as a student assistant for [Frank van Tubergen](https://www.frankvantubergen.nl/), who also supervised my master thesis. My time in Utrecht resulted in publishing two papers, more details [here](https://anastasia-menshikova.github.io/publications/).

I am a PhD student at the [Institute for Analytical Sociology](https://liu.se/en/organisation/liu/iei/ias) in Norrköping, Sweden. My research focuses on cultural change at an individual and structural level in the context of public discourse. My PhD advisors are [Marc Keuschnigg](https://keuschnigg.org/), [Selcan Mutgan](https://www.selcanmutgan.com/), and [Måns Magnusson](https://www.mansmagnusson.com/). Here you can check [my full CV](https://anastasia-menshikova.github.io/assets/CV_menshikova_apr24.pdf).

Along with learning how to do good research during my PhD time, I find important making academia a friendlier place for women and supporting open discussions of academics' mental health.

## PhD Studies
I am doing my research under the umbrella of [Mining for Meaning](https://liu.se/en/research/computational-text-analysis) project. I study immigration debate in Sweden and beyond using computational text analysis methods and quasi-experimental designs. I use a combination of digital trace data from social media, digitized newspaper archives, survey data, and event databases in my work.

## Text Analysis Research Group at IAS
At the Institute for Analytical Sociology, I organize monthly (online or hybrid) meetings  bringing together sociologists enthusiastic about computational text analysis from Swedish and other European universities. We discuss fundamental or novel research in the field of text analysis, invite guest speakers and present our work to each other. Send me an email to anastasia.menshikova@liu.se if you want to know more or join our discussion sessions!

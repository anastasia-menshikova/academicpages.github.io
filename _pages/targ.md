At the Institute for Analytical Sociology, I organize monthly (online or hybrid) meetings bringing together sociologists enthusiastic about computational text analysis from Swedish and other European universities. We discuss fundamental or novel research in the field of text analysis, invite guest speakers and present our work to each other. Send me an email to anastasia.menshikova@liu.se if you want to know more or join our discussion sessions!
